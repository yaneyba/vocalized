# Vocalized Documentation

This folder collects reference guides that explain how the Vocalized dashboard is structured, how to run it locally, and how to extend the experience. Start here to find the topic you need:

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) — install dependencies, run the dev server, and understand the available npm scripts.
- [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) — learn how routing, layouts, data fetching, and styling work together.
- [Data Layer Reference](data-layer.md) — explore the `IDataProvider` contract, mock data sources, and how to wire up real APIs.
- [UI Components & Patterns](ui-components.md) — review reusable UI primitives, Tailwind usage, and design conventions.

As the project grows, add more references here so teammates can understand new features and patterns quickly.
